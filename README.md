# Dashboard UI Built with Next.js

This project is a modern dashboard UI inspired by an incredible one-page screenshot from **Ronas IT | UI/UX Team** on Dribbble. The journey began with a single image that sparked the challenge of transforming a static visual into a fully interactive, responsive, and visually engaging dashboard using cutting-edge web technologies.

## üåü Inspiration

The design inspiration came from a stunning dashboard concept seen on Dribbble. Despite having only one image as a reference, it drove the creativity and effort needed to craft a functional UI that captures the same aesthetic appeal while adding dynamic elements and interactive features.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15**: Chosen for its powerful features like server-side rendering and static site generation, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for efficient styling and flexibility, making it easy to implement a clean and customizable design.
- **Framer Motion**: Used to add smooth and elegant animations, elevating the overall user experience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bendada-abdelmajid/dashboardui.git


```bash
#1
cd dashboardui
#2
npm install
#3

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## üìã Features
**Responsive Layout** : Adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless user experience across all devices.
**Animated Interactions**: Leveraging Framer Motion, the UI includes smooth transitions and engaging animations.
**Utility-First Styling**: Tailwind CSS made it easy to achieve a polished look with minimal effort.

## üöÄ Future Improvements
Expanding the dashboard with additional pages and components.
Connecting to real data sources for more dynamic content.
Experimenting with advanced animation techniques using Framer Motion.
